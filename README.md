## Goal

This is a NLP project, the goal is to against sexism speech on internet, which can detect and perhaps generate counter speech.

### Problems we have encountered

1. Which model to use to detect a sexism speech?
2. Which model to use to generate counter speech?
3. How to systematically compare different models for the above questions.
4. After find the model, how should we deploy them so the users can use them?

### Answers to our problems

1. to be found
2. to be found
3. to be found
4. Perhaps like a promt, users type in a sentence that they think it maybe contains sexism. Or we provide APIs that chatbot in e.g. Telegram or Discord can use, to automatically detect the sexism speech in group chat.
